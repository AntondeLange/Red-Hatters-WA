Furthermore, such individuals should not use Red Hat Society trade dress colors, red and purple, pink and lavender, or combinations thereof in any way which would confuse the general public to believe that they continue to be associated with or represent the Red Hat Society or its members.</p>

					<h2>Logo and Trademark Usage</h2>
					<p>The Red Hat Society name is a registered trademark of The Red Hat Society, Inc. Our logo above the hat and sash, the sash alone, and Ruby Red Hat and other names and marks are also copyrighted by and/or trademarks of The Red Hat Society, Inc. protected under law. The Red Hat Society logo pictured above is the exclusive intellectual property of The Red Hat Society, Inc. Membership in the Red Hat Society does not give a person the right to use the name, logo, Ruby RedHat, or any other copyright or trademark. However, membership does give an individual special privileges with respect to the use of the Red Hat Society chapter logo and trademark, as delineated in the paragraphs to follow. Any person or group that uses the Red Hat Society name, logo, chapter logo, or Ruby RedHat graphic for profit without prior written authorization by The Red Hat Society, Inc. will be subject to prosecution under law.</p>
					
					<h3>Chapter Logo</h3>
					<p>The Red Hat Society Chapter Logo may be used by members of Red Hat Society chapters on Red Hat Society chapter web sites, name tags, chapter rosters, chapter newsletters, chapter event fliers, and the like without special permission, provided that it is not used to market or endorse goods or services of any kind, used to defame the Red Hat Society in any way, or used in connection with objectionable material, as determined by The Red Hat Society, Inc. We do however specify that any chapter member using the chapter logo must include the name of her chapter above, beside or below the Red Hat Society Chapter logo to avoid confusion.</p>
					
					<p><em>For Example: "The Good Golly, Miss Molly" Chapter of Red Hat Society.</em></p>
					
					<p>A downloadable picture of the Red Hat Society Chapter Logo graphic is available online to Supporting Members. If you are a Chapter Queen or a Supportings Member, you may download it at any time by clicking here.</p>
					
					<p>Any use of Red Hat Society copyrights or trademarks beyond those specified above require prior written approval from The Red Hat Society, Inc. Such permission is not regularly given but may be obtained in exceptional and appropriate circumstances by contacting the Red Hat Society at its HatQuarters in Fullerton California.</p>

				<div class="terms-section">
					<h2>Chapter Website Policies</h2>
					<p>The following policies are part of Membership Terms and Conditions for those who wish to create Red Hat Society chapter web sites. Please review Membership Terms and Conditions in conjunction with the content herein.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Chapter web sites must not represent the chapter as part of an independent organization.</li>
						<li>It must be clear from looking at the web site that it represents a chapter of the Red Hat Society and that it is not the Red Hat Society web site. The chapter name indicating such affiliation and a link to redhatsociety.montonton.com must be present on the home page of the chapter web site. This avoids confusion for those who are attempting to find the main Red Hat Society web site.</li>
						<li>A chapter should not use the poem, "Warning", by Jenny Joseph on its web site or violate copyright or trademark law in any way.</li>
						<li>A chapter web site may not be used to misrepresent or malign the Red Hat Society or any of its members or other chapters, and must not libel or defame anyone.</li>
						<li>Chapter web sites must not be used for the purpose of selling goods or services. A chapter must not use the Red Hat Society name, logo, or any other copyright or trademark of the Red Hat Society on a web site that sells goods or services which are not offered or licensed by The Red Hat Society, Inc.</li>
						<li>There should be no direct link from a Red Hat Society chapter page to other sites offering goods or services aimed at members of the Red Hat Society, which are not offered or licensed by The Red Hat Society, Inc.</li>
						<li>Chapters are welcome to use the Red Hat Society Chapter Logo graphic on their chapter web sites. The logo file is provided below.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p><em>To download the above logo, right-click and choose "Save to disk" or "Save as…" and save it to your computer desktop. For Mac users: clicking and holding the button down is the same as a right-click.</em></p>
					
					<p>We reserve the right to remove the link from our site at any time and for any reason whatsoever, without prior notice.</p>
					<p><strong>We thank you for your cooperation and are glad that you have built a website!</strong></p>

					<h2>Chapter Event Policies</h2>
					<h3>Policy Regarding Red Hat Society Chapter-Sponsored Events</h3>
					<p>Red Hat Society chapters may:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Plan local events which involve other chapters or interested individuals.</li>
						<li>Use their specific chapter names to advertise and promote such gatherings.</li>
						<li>Notify HatQuarters of the event if it is large enough that it may conflict with a Red Hat Society event already in the planning stages.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p><strong>Red Hat Society chapters may not:</strong></p>
					<ol>
						<li>Plan events which involve negotiations with outside parties, such as hotels or travel agencies, etc. using the Red Hat Society name.</li>
						<li>Publicize a chapter-sponsored event as a Red Hat Society event.</li>
						<li>Plan events which may be considered questionable in nature and use their Red Hat Society affiliation to publicize such events.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<div class="example-box">
						<h4>Example 1 (An example of how to do it):</h4>
						<p>Queen Mother "A " decides to plan a train hoot to a neighboring town and she wants to invite other local Red Hat Society chapters to join her group. She publicizes the event by stating that her chapter, The Purple Plumes of the Red Hat Society, is planning to go on a train hoot. The train company wants a guaranteed minimum number of tickets sold if they are going to add an extra car to the train for A's friends. A's chapter guarantees that if 300 people don't come, the Purple Plumes chapter will be the responsible party to pay whatever fees are due. "A" makes sure that the train company knows that this is The Purple Plumes' responsibility, not the responsibility of The Red Hat Society, Inc.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="example-box">
						<h4>Example 2 (An example of how NOT to do it):</h4>
						<p>Queen Mother "B" decides that she's going to plan a big regional event. She's going to call this one the "Red Hat Society Northern Regional Convention" because so many people are bound to show up.</p>
						<p>She contacts a local hotel to arrange for a discounted rate for her attendees. In order to get the rate, she has to guarantee that a certain number of rooms will be sold. She agrees to the minimum number of rooms and tells the hotel that this is a Red Hat Society event. She forgets to mention that this event is sponsored by her chapter, which will be responsible, and is not a Red Hat Society event, and that she is not an official representative of The Red Hat Society, Inc.</p>
						<p>As it turns out, the number of attendees isn't as great as "B" had hoped. She ends up owing the hotel $10,000.00. Since she can't pay it, the hotel calls the Red Hat Society, Inc. and demands payment.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="example-box">
						<h4>Example 3 (Another example of how NOT to do it):</h4>
						<p>Queen Mother "X" decides to take a walk on the wild side with her chapter. They're going to the local strip bar. She invites other Red Hat Society chapters to attend and tells the local newspaper about the event. The newspaper publishes an article about the Red Hat Society that would make anyone blush.</p>
					</div>
					
					<p>We hope that these seemingly silly but all too real examples clarify things a bit.</p>
					
					<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> We would very much appreciate it if members planning a large event (involving more than 500 people) would notify Red Hat Society HatQuarters before proceeding, as we may already have an event slated for a similar time and place. This eliminates the risk involved on both sides. If you have thought about putting on a large event and inviting the chapters in your region but have not yet begun serious planning, please contact the RHS via email or phone first (email to events@redhatsociety.com–skip-themes, phone 714-738-0001). That way, we can be sure that any events in the planning phases at HatQuarters will not conflict or compete with your plans. Or, if you'd like, we may be able to collaborate with you on the planning.</p>
