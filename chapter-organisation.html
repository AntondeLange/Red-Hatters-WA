					<h2>Fundraising Ideas</h2>
					<p>Generally speaking, Hatters don't do fundraising. However there may be times when chapters want to raise money to help a particular charity, or to raise chapter funds for convention costuming or other chapter needs.</p>
					
					<div class="idea-grid">
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i> Fines</h5>
							<p>Charge a $2 fine for forgetting to wear a hat or name-badge, or for being late</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-gavel"></i> Craft Auctions</h5>
							<p>If you have crafty members who can create something like hats, cards, jewellery or even baked goods, you could auction these off. Either splitting the profits with the person donating the items, or with the chapter keeping all profits.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-birthday-cake"></i> Bake Sale</h5>
							<p>Have members bake cupcakes, muffins, slices and other individual portioned foods, then come together for a bake sale where everyone buys a cupcake etc. for a nominated price per item (eg $1/$2 each) with proceeds going to the chapter.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-paint-brush"></i> Cupcake Decorating</h5>
							<p>Everyone pays $2 to decorate their cupcake, with decorating items provided by the chapter (eg red and purple frosting, choc chips and other fun things). The chapter then keeps any profits made.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Book Sale</h5>
							<p>Members bring old books they no longer need and these are then sold off for $2 each or auctioned to raise money.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-gift"></i> Lucky Dip</h5>
							<p>Have a selection of inexpensive items wrapped up, and charge $1-$2 per go.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-ticket-alt"></i> Raffle Auction</h5>
							<p>(AKA Penny sale) Each member buys a set of raffle tickets or coupons (eg 10 tickets for $1), and there are several items to raffle off, each with a bowl next to them. Members put their raffle tickets into the bowls of the items they want (they can choose to put one ticket in the bowl or several tickets if they really want it) â then each item has the winner drawn from the bowls.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> Mystery Auction</h5>
							<p>Everyone brings a wrapped gift worth $5 or $10, in a particular theme. People then bid on the mystery package without knowing what is inside it. You could set a maximum bid for each item so that it doesn't go beyond a certain limit. The chapter gets to keep all raised funds.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> $2 Raffle</h5>
							<p>Have a prize worth $2 and everyone puts $2 into a jar as their entry to the raffle, and their name goes into a hat. The person who gets drawn from the hat gets the prize, and they then buy the prize for the next month raffle.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-candy-cane"></i> Lolly Jar</h5>
							<p>Have a jar of lollies and everyone pays $2 to have a guess at how many lollies are in the jar. The winner gets to keep the lollies and the chapter keeps the money.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-utensils"></i> Cook Book</h5>
							<p>Have members send in their favourite tried and true recipes, gather them together, then have them printed and bound. Sell the books to cover the cost of printing plus extra funds for the chapter.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-car"></i> Car Wash</h5>
							<p>Have members bring their cars along and pay a fee to have their car washed (bonus if you can rope in husbands/children to wash the cars, then all the Hatters can gather around relaxing while their cars are being washed!)</p>

		<!-- Hosting an Event Section -->
		<section class="chapter-section" style="background: var(--light-gray);">
			<div class="container">
				<div class="chapter-card">
					<h2>Hosting an Event</h2>
					<p>You may like to hold a larger get-together with ladies from other local chapters, or open it up to invite any Hatters from around Victoria or even around Australia. Running a larger event can be a bit daunting so here are some tips:</p>
					
					<h3>Choosing a Date</h3>
					<p>Pick a date that doesn't conflict with any existing Hatter events or any public holidays. Make sure to check the upcoming events and our Facebook Group events. If your event is a large one that interstate Hatters might like to attend, make sure it's not on when any other large events are on (in any State)</p>
					
					<h3>Venues</h3>
					<p>Choose a venue that has good parking and ideally good facilities for those with mobility issues and access to public transport. If serving food, check they can cater for food intolerances.</p>
					
					<div class="idea-grid">
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-tree"></i> Picnic</h5>
							<p>Attendees bring their own food, and you can find a park that won't cost money to hire. Be aware that you'll need toilets and shade might also be good to have. Check insurance issues and if any council regulations apply.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-utensils"></i> Restaurant Meal</h5>
							<p>Attendees will pay for their own meal and drinks. The venue will have insurance, making this a nice easy way to have an event. Although numbers might be limited due to space. Also make sure to choose restaurants that will allow each guest to pay for their own meal (usually "clubs" do this, smaller restaurants usually do not)</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-building"></i> Private Room/Venue</h5>
							<p>These usually require you to pay a fee to hire the space, and you'll also pay a price per head for each meal. When doing this, you will need to make sure you cover your costs. Make sure you add up how much the venue hire costs, plus any decorations you need to buy, and any other expenses (not including the food costs at this point). If you are including goodies/prizes, factor those in too.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<h3>Pacing</h3>
					<p>Not all Hatters can cope with a lot of physical activity or a long event. So if you have a multiple day event, you may need to schedule a rest time between morning and evening events. Some ladies might want to go back to their rooms to freshen up and change clothes.</p>
					
					<p>If you have an event where attendees will need to move from one building/activity to another, make sure to allow plenty of time for those who walk slowly. If you are having games and activities, make sure to allow plenty of time for everyone to move around and get ready.</p>
					
					<h3>Give all the Information</h3>
					<p>Make sure your attendees know everything they need: Cost, date, time, when payment is due, how to make payment (on the day or in advance), dresscode, expectations (eg if there will be anything unusual like walking/stairs/games), who is running it â and anything else you think they should know beforehand.</p>
					
					<p>Depending on the venue, giving information on parking, accommodation options in the area and other such things can also be very helpful for your guests.</p>
					
					<h3>Advance Notice</h3>
					<p>Give plenty of advanced warning/notice of the event (even post a "saving the date" if you have a date in mind but no further details ready) â so everyone has time to prepare (including you!!).</p>
					
					<p>This allows your attendees to keep the date free, set money aside and it also allows other Chapters to know when your event is when planning their own to avoid conflicts.</p>
					
					<h3>Public Liability Insurance</h3>
					<p>If you do not have a policy to cover your chapter, then you may wish to choose venues that have their own insurance cover. Check liabilities of hosting in public parks and at member homes etc.</p>
					
					<h3>Format of your event notices</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Saving your event flyer/promo as an <strong>image</strong> is the best way for it to be shared in a way everyone can view it properly.</li>
						<li>Flyers as a .doc or .docx can be unreadable for some Hatters, and often any layout and fonts you use will not look the same when opened on the other person's computer/laptop/phone. So this is not recommended for event notices.</li>
						<li>Save your .doc files document as a .pdf file instead to preserve the same look and make it readable.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<div class="tip-box">
						<h4>Easy & Pretty Way to Make Event Flyers</h4>
						<p>The easiest way to make a great looking flyer that you can save as an image is to use <a href="https://www.canva.com" target="_blank" style="color: var(--white); text-decoration: underline;">www.Canva.com</a> (which is a free online tool)</p>
						<p>This allows you to make great looking event flyers (and other things), using graphics and templates they provide, and you can move things around and add your own text. You can then download the creation as an image or a .pdf (or both!).</p>
					</div>
					
					<h3>Registration/Booking Forms</h3>
					<p>Some event hosts like to provide a registration form where attendees have to fill out their details and sign a waiver â rather than simply having the attendees email or phone to RSVP.</p>
					
					<p>While you may only need to know their name so you can make sure you know how many (and who) is attending, it is also a good idea to have at least their phone number and email address in case you need to contact them to inform them of any changes to the event.</p>
					
					<div class="warning-box">
						<h5><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Important Security Note</h5>
						<p>You should NEVER request or send credit card information via email, facebook, messenger, whatsapp etc. These are NOT secure enough to transmit sensitive information such as credit card information! Send this information over the phone instead.</p>
					</div>
					
					<h3>Indemnity Waivers</h3>
					<p>Indemnity forms added with booking forms can be problematic for the reasons stated above with booking forms.</p>
					
					<p>An alternative to having Hatters complete a waiver at registration may be to have as part of the booking process wording that says that by booking and attending this event, you agree to the terms of the waiver. So long as that's clear, then all attendees have agreed to your terms by the fact they are at the event.</p>
					
					<p>A sign-in sheet at the event that includes a waiver may also be a good option regardless of whether your booking form includes one or not â so all those attending have to sign in, which also signs the waiver, as well as providing you with a list of those who actually attended.</p>

					<h2>How to Attract New Members to Your Chapter</h2>
					<p>Growing your chapter with new members is essential for its success and longevity. Here are effective strategies to attract new Hatters:</p>
					
					<h3>Word of Mouth</h3>
					<p>Your best recruitment tool is your existing members! Encourage them to invite friends, family members, and acquaintances who might enjoy the Red Hat Society experience.</p>
					
					<h3>Community Involvement</h3>
					<div class="idea-grid">
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i> Public Events</h5>
							<p>Participate in community festivals, fairs, and events wearing your red hats and purple outfits. This creates visibility and curiosity.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-newspaper"></i> Local Media</h5>
							<p>Submit articles to local newspapers about your chapter's activities and community involvement. Many papers love featuring local groups.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-bullhorn"></i> Social Media</h5>
							<p>Create a Facebook page or Instagram account for your chapter. Share photos and stories of your activities to attract interest.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-store"></i> Local Businesses</h5>
							<p>Ask local businesses if you can display flyers or business cards. Many are happy to support community groups.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<h3>Open House Events</h3>
					<p>Host special "Open House" events where potential members can attend a meeting or activity to see what your chapter is all about. This gives them a chance to meet current members and experience the fun firsthand.</p>
					
					<h3>Recruitment Strategies</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Be Approachable:</strong> Always wear a smile and be welcoming to newcomers</li>
						<li><strong>Share Your Story:</strong> Tell people about the friendships and fun you've found in the Red Hat Society</li>
						<li><strong>Offer Trial Memberships:</strong> Let potential members attend a few meetings before committing</li>
						<li><strong>Create Inviting Materials:</strong> Develop attractive flyers and brochures about your chapter</li>
						<li><strong>Partner with Other Groups:</strong> Collaborate with other women's organizations for joint events</li>
					</ul>
					
					<div class="highlight-box">
						<h3>Remember: Quality Over Quantity</h3>
						<p>It's better to have a smaller group of committed, enthusiastic members than a large group of people who aren't truly engaged. Focus on finding women who share your passion for fun, friendship, and the Red Hat Society spirit.</p>

					<h2>Welcoming a New Member</h2>
					<p>Making new members feel welcome and included is crucial for their success in your chapter. Here's how to create a warm, inviting experience:</p>
					
					<h3>First Meeting Experience</h3>
					<div class="idea-grid">
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-handshake"></i> Personal Greeting</h5>
							<p>Have a designated "Welcome Committee" member greet new arrivals personally and introduce them to other members.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-tag"></i> Name Tags</h5>
							<p>Provide clear name tags for everyone, including the new member, to help with introductions and remember names.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-gift"></i> Welcome Gift</h5>
							<p>Consider giving a small welcome gift like a Red Hat Society pin, bookmark, or small trinket to make them feel special.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="idea-card">
							<h5><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Information Packet</h5>
							<p>Provide a packet with chapter information, meeting schedule, contact details, and Red Hat Society basics.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<h3>Integration Strategies</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Buddy System:</strong> Assign a current member as a "buddy" to help the new member navigate their first few meetings</li>
						<li><strong>Ice Breakers:</strong> Include fun ice breaker activities that help everyone get to know each other</li>
						<li><strong>Seat Them Strategically:</strong> Place new members with friendly, outgoing members who will include them in conversations</li>
						<li><strong>Explain Traditions:</strong> Take time to explain any chapter-specific traditions or inside jokes</li>
						<li><strong>Ask for Input:</strong> Encourage new members to share their ideas and suggestions</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>Follow-Up</h3>
					<p>Don't let the welcome end after the first meeting. Follow up with new members to ensure they're feeling comfortable and answer any questions they might have.</p>
					
					<div class="tip-box">
						<h4>Creating an Inclusive Environment</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Make sure everyone has a chance to speak and be heard</li>

							<li>Be patient with new members as they learn the ropes</li>
							<li>Celebrate their unique contributions and perspectives</li>
							<li>Remember that everyone was new once â treat them as you would want to be treated</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="highlight-box">
